# How to get help with installing packages

If your code produced many messages or warnings, helpers will often need to see _all_ of those messages to diagnose the problem. The last message alone may be completely uninformative.

To figure out what’s going wrong, we’ll need some more information. Here are the things that are most helpful to provide when asking questions about package installation problems:

1. The exact name of the package you are trying to install. Remember, R is case sensitive!
1. **All** the console output you see when you try to install the package
1. The output of running `sessionInfo()`

Here is how you should provide that information:

1. In a new post on a blank line, click the little <kbd> `</>` </kbd> button at the top of the posting box. This will insert a small template with the words “type or paste code here” selected.
1. Copy the output from the console (no screenshots please!)
2. Paste the output here, replacing the “type or paste code here” line in the template,

Following these steps makes it easier for helpers to read what you post and keeps the forum software from garbling it.

## Try this first

There are a few package installation problems that crop up over and over. Before asking a question, see if your problem fits into one of these common scenarios:

### Old R

### Default library path with non-ASCII characters (is this Windows only?)

### Need R Tools on Windows

But, check **Old R** first!

Also, did package just get updated on CRAN? If so, the binary might not have reached your mirror yet.

### R can't reach the internet

### Trying to install a BioConductor package from CRAN
